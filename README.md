# Very simple app example (Cross Platform)

This is a very simple app for me to teach basic very flutter concepts: 

- Material Design.
- Widgets "Stateless and Stateful widget". 
- Navigation. 
- Working with images.
- The app uses setState to manage state.

## Getting Started

You should first download Flutter to your computer, just follow this link: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

Clone this project into your machine and run it =)
